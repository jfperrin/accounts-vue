# Accounts-vue

This projects is a complete rewriting of an [account application in react](https://github.com/jfperrin/accounts-react). My goal here is to discover [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) in a complete website with passport, graphQL, etc.

## vue-cli
In order to start this project I used [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) to generate the base project. I just ran the folowing command.

```
 # Installation of vue-cli
yarn global add @vue/cli

# Creation
vue create accounts-vue
```
